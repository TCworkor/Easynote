## What is Easynote?

1. An app that is simple to use with a clean interface!
2. An app that simply aims to bring convenience to everyone!
3. An app that doesn't collect personal data (because it doesn't connect to the internet) and has no ads!

## Features of EasyNote?

1. **Quick Input**: Reduce typing with fast input methods for added convenience in using the software!
2. Compact and Simple: With pure functionality, it's designed to help you **cultivate a habit of scheduling**!
3. Author's Open-Source Software: There are **no commercial motives behind it**, so feel free to use it with confidence!



## Important Notice!

**Since it is currently in the testing phase, in order for the alarm function to work properly, you need to grant the "Jinji" app the permission to run in the background from the app's background management on your phone.**
