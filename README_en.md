2. An app that simply aims to bring convenience to everyone!
3. An app that doesn't collect personal data (because it doesn't connect to the internet) and has no ads!

## Important Notice!

**Since it is currently in the testing phase, in order for the alarm function to work properly, you need to grant the "Jinji" app the permission to run in the background from the app's background management on your phone.**
